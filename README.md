## AntiScamBL

This is a blocklist for scambaiters and people who are on the front-lines fighting scammers. The idea here is to make a highly tolerant service which requires little infrastructure so that if a scambaiter encounters a threat (e.g. fake tech support, etc) it can be raised rapidly and merged rapidly. The goal is then to provide this to other people so that they can use the information listed here to block threats quickly. 

The idea of having DNS is -- to create a rapidly-updated blocklist for specific scam threats since they change information rapidly, the blocklist can change rapidly as well.
